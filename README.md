# Async Express.js Route Handler Unhandled Error
This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Express.js route handlers where errors are not properly handled, leading to unexpected behavior. The provided `bug.js` file shows an example of this error, while `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected implementation.

## Problem
The issue arises when an asynchronous operation within a route handler throws an error. If the error handling isn't placed correctly, the error might be swallowed and not reported, leading to silent failures and making debugging challenging.  The incorrect implementation relies on a `.catch` block not in the same scope, resulting in the unhandled error.

## Solution
The solution involves restructuring the code to ensure that error handling is handled appropriately within the same scope as the operation that could potentially throw the error. Using `async/await` and proper `try...catch` blocks provide a more robust and manageable solution to handling these errors gracefully.
